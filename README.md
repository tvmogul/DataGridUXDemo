# DataGridUXDemo
DataGridUXDemo is an advanced jQuery DataTable that demonstrates drag-and-drop column  grouping via a visual group zone with clear visual indicators.  The view supports runtime theme switching between light and dark modes using  Bootstrap 5’s global theming, while also allowing the table header theme to  be toggled independently.
